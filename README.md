## 📖 Project Breakdown
**Simple. Secure. C Sharp.** 🔷

This project is a desktop application designed to handle **User Authentication**. Think of it as a digital door lock: you input your username and password, and the system checks its "guest list" (database or hardcoded logic) to see if you're allowed inside.

**Key Features:**
* **🔑 Access Control:** Validates user credentials against stored data.
* **🖥️ GUI Interface:** Built with Windows Forms (WinForms) for a native Windows experience.
* **🛡️ Security Basics:** Demonstrates fundamental logic for protecting software routes.
